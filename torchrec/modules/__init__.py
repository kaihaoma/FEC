"""Torchrec Common Modules

The torchrec modules contain a collection of various modules.

These modules include:
    - extensions of `nn.Embedding` and `nn.EmbeddingBag`, called `EmbeddingBagCollection`
      and `EmbeddingCollection` respectively.
    - established modules such as `DeepFM <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04247.pdf>`_ and
      `CrossNet <https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05123>`_.
    - common module patterns such as `MLP` and `SwishLayerNorm`.
    - custom modules for torchrec such as `PositionWeightedModule` and
      `LazyModuleExtensionMixin`.
